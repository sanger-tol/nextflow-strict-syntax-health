## About

This report is generated weekly by running `nextflow lint` on each nf-core pipeline.
The linting checks for strict syntax compliance in Nextflow DSL2 code.

- **Errors** indicate syntax issues that will cause problems in future Nextflow versions
- **Warnings** indicate deprecated patterns that should be updated
